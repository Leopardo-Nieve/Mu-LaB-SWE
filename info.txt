The simulation visually replicates the results expected.
Inlet and outlet consistency checks succed until convergence.
---

Modifications since last version:
- Reduced the consistency criterion

- Increased the convergence criterion

- Initialized the velocities after the bed was defined

- Made the initial velocity global and equal to the discharge over the depth at that node (i.e. u = q_in/h)

---

Potential next step(s):

- Make code clean (no more debugging lines)

- Update code summary

- When the analytical solution is available, compare the results in post-processing.
