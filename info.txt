Behaviour is still not physical. Bump still does not create a dip.
Outlet depth tends towards 0 within 300 timesteps. The consistency test fails early.
There is a slight dip before the bump.

Unsure what criteria to use to enforce consistency condition.

Modifications since last version:
- Added a consistency check criterion to the setup module

- Made global initial velocity null again
---

Potential next step(s):
- Create 2 new branches: 
1. Removing inflow and outflow boundaries and replacing with periodic boundaries and a body force
2. Removing the bed geometry
3. (Maybe) using a case with liquid flowing down an incline without body force
