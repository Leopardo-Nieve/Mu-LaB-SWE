Simulation fails at timestep 9731 because some value reaches infinity.

Modifications since last version:
- Created BCInflow and BCOutflow character variables (equivalent to strings) and left them at 1 character to make conditional statements more cohesive

- Removed the hIn, uIn, hOut, uOut variables to favour directly defining the macroscopic variables (thus affecting feq calculations) as recommended by Zhou (p.58)

- Restructured Inflow_Outflow_BC subroutine to allow different conditions

- Rewrote Neumann condition integration to only apply to unkown populations perpendicular to boundary as recommended by Zhou (p.58)

- Stopped using the consistency equations because a simple zero gradient and Dirichlet conditions combination were used

---

Potential next step(s):

- Compare values at the inlet to verify Dirichlet boundary is correctly applied

- Validate that Neumann condition is correctly applied

- Trace profiles with time to see which value first diverges from the analytical solution
