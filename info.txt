Inlet consistency check fails after 1 timestep. Before fluid is in motion, consistency succeeds. 
The left side of the equation seems responsible because it decreases rapidly whereas the right side takes the expected value.
Perhaps the streaming coming from the still nodes impacts consistency.
Outlet condition seems to work perfectly.

Modifications since last version:
- Merged branch 'periodic-BC-&-artif-body-force' into periodic-y-bc

- Moved all initial property prints into a bloc to make it easier to comment or uncomment them all

- To reduce the amount of prints in terminal: commented the: 
1. "call end_simulation" line 
2.  printing when consistency fails 

- Added debugging prints

Potential next step(s):

- Apply a global initial velocity such that uo = q_in/ho, i.e., the discharge is constant throughout, but the velocity will decrease with depth.
