New case naming runs older simulation nicely. 
---

Modifications since last version:
- Renamed LABSWE.F90 to Mu_LaB_SWE.f90

- Renamed program to run.exe in tasks.json and launch.json

- Deleted steady_flow_over_bump.exe and labswe.mod

- Used Mu_LaB_SWE in main instead of LABSWE

---

Potential next step(s):

- Compare with yesterday's files and incorporate edits to introduce new case.
