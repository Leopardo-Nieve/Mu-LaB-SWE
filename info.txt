Results opf depth are way overestimated, but boundary conditions are properly enforced. Likely an issue with the new way body forces are defined and assigned.
---

Modifications since last version:

- modified collide_stream subroutine to call force indices correctly (positive offset by one node)

- added lines to write_csv to create a new file that stores all the body force and its constituents' values

---

Potential next step(s):

- compare state after one timestep with 2nd order body force term case
