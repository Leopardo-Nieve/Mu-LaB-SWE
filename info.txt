Behaviour is still not physical. Non-physical depth at entrance seems to cause negative populations and depth never settles to 2 m.
Bump does not create a dip: it's almost as if the bump had no impact on the depth, i.e. surface profile varies very little with x.
Simulation is conservative (q is constant at every node).

modifications:
- added iteration tracker variable (current_iteration)

- modified write_csv to add simulation parameters above header and added column for q (m^2/s)

- moved check_convergence function to end of LABSWE module


potential next steps:
- verify outlet condition to impose depth at outlet and compare results
