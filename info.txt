New case: Tidal Flow over a Regular Bed
---

Modifications since last version:

- Renamed LABSWE.f90 to Mu-LaB-SWE

- modified launch.json and tasks.json to have the program named Mu-LaB-SWE.exe

Potential next step(s):

- Update bed geometry

- Update BC'simulation

- Make main code more dynamic (inputs define BC's, for example)
