Results opf depth are way overestimated, but boundary conditions are properly enforced. Likely an issue with the new way body forces are defined and assigned.
---

Modifications since last version:

- created position variable to make geometry easier to create

- created hCentered variable to allow body force to be defined between nodes

- created hLast variable to be able to use convergence criterion Zhou used (2002)

- changed epsilon's definition and use in check_convergence to match Zhou's definition (2002)

- changed dimensions of all arrays involved in body force calculation to have double the refinement

- adapted bathymetry and slope definitions to adjust for new array dimensions

- created update_body_force subroutine to update the body force at each timestep (depth varies)

- modified collide_stream subroutine to use centred body force scheme [LIKELY WHERE ERROR WAS COMMITTED]

- modified Inflow_Outflow_BC to accurately outflow BC (defined u from consistency check equation)

- modified task.json to call Mu-LaB-SWE.f90 as an argument and create run.exe

Potential next step(s):

- test case where body force is not continuously updated to see if error is amplified or reduced
