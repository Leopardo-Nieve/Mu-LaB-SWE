Non physical bump (because force is not centered scheme?)

depth surges at entrance (bad inlet conditions?)

modifications:

- added convergence check as criteria to end loop

- added max value of e before getting negative equilibrium density functions

- made zb a 2D array 

- made e=15 m/s again

- used Zhou's parameters to replicate his results

- some debugging lines
