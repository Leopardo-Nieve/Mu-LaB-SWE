Behaviour is still not physical. Non-physical depth at entrance seems to cause negative populations and depth never settles to 2 m.

- calculated space-averaged force in collision_streaming subroutine for centered force scheme

- commented negative population detector lines

- reduced espilon (convergence criterion)
