Behaviour is still not physical. Bump still does not create a dip.
Outlet depth tends towards 0 within 300 timesteps. The consistency test fails early.
There is a slight dip before the bump.

Unsure what criteria to use to enforce consistency condition.

Modifications since last version:
- Added a consistency check criterion

- defined global initial velocity as inlet velocity, i.e., q_in/ho
---

Potential next step(s):
- Assign values to initial mesoscopic populations as well as macroscopic values for inlet and outlet boundary conditions. It may enforce the consistency equation and thus create a physical depth at the inlet.
