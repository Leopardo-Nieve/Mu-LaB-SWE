Behaviour is still not physical. Bump still does not create a dip.
Outlet depth tends towards 0 within 300 timesteps. The consistency test fails early.
There is a slight dip before the bump.

Unsure what criteria to use to enforce consistency condition.

Modifications since last version:
- Removed call to Inflow_Outflow_BC subroutine

- Applied periodic boundary conditions

- Commented the consistency check during setup

- Corrected force term in collide_stream subroutine (instead of 0.5d0, the term written was 0.05d0)

- Corrected the sign of the slope force (should be negative)

- Added an artificial body force of 0.66 m^2/s^2 to reach a velocity of approximately 2.2 m/s 

- Updated the launch.json file so that the debugger works in the file location

- Updated the task.json file so that the build task launches by default with the "ctrl + shift + B" hotkey
---

Potential next step(s):
- Modify launch.json so that the debugger works using relative filepaths and not absolutes to find the program

- Debug the inlet-outlet boundary conditions
