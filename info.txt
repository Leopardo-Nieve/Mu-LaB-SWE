Behaviour is finally physical. Bump creates a dip after enough timesteps.
Inlet consistency check fails after 1 timestep. populations 3 and/or 9 seem responsible
Outlet condition seems to work perfectly.

Modifications since last version:
- Added u_out variable for the outlet velocity

- Activated Inflow-Outflow lines

- Commented periodic boundaries in x-direction

- Modified ouflow consistency check to use assigned variables (h_out and u_out)

- Removed artificial body force

- Activated call Inflow-Outflow line

---

Potential next step(s):

-  Merge branch back onto periodic-y-bc branch

- Find the origin of the variation of populations 3 and 9 after timestep 1
