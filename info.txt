Consistency fails at first timestep, and only gets worse with time.
Depth seems underestimated, i.e. the depth BC does not increase quickly enough.
The velocity is quasi null, which is far from the analytical solution (~0.1 m/s at the timestep of failure).

Modifications since last version:
- Added pi variable

- Added steadyFlow logical (boolean) variable to define if the simulation is steady (true) or tidal (false)

- Deleted ho variable

- Added hIn and uIn variables with dimensions (Ly)

- Added uIn and hIn definition at each time step in Inflow_Outflow_BC subroutine

- Added bed geometry definition

- Renamed u_out and h_out to uOut and hOut

---

Potential next step(s):

- Print the different values of the different consistency equations and determine sources of error

- Investigate why depth is underestimated
